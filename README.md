Supplementary materials to "Spin-optomechanical quantum interface enabled by an ultrasmall mechanical and optical mode volume cavity" by H. Raniwala, S. Krastanov, M. Eichenfield, and D. R. Englund, 2022

Main content:

- `two-mode-squeeze-herald.jl` - A Pluto notebook deriving the fidelity of heralded single-phonons obtained from two mode squeezing.
- `probability_vs_fidelity_wrt_temperature.ipynb` - An IPython notebook with the datasets and computation necessary to predict the Q factor of diamond mechanical resonators at various temperatures. Also contains the subsequent predictions concerning the fidelity of single phonon generation.
